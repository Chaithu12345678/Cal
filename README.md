| screenshots                               | contains example images of running program in light and dark mode           |
| src/main/resources                        | contains light and dark theme specifications                                |
| src/main/java/com.houarizegai.calculator  | contains bulk of code, including App.java (main function), theme directory (containing all theme helper functions), ui directory (containing all ui component initilizations, calculation functions, and CalculatorUI function to initalize entire UI) and the util directory (contains coloring specifications)                                                                                                           |
| src/test                                  | contains testing functions                                                  |

## Functionality Outline:
* program calls a new instance of the CalculatorUI class, during initilization:
  * theme is loaded
  * window size is determined
  * components visible to user (like buttons are initilized)
 * while program is running, initButtons() will listen for user interaction and call the calculate() function when necessary
## Testing
 * testing function implemented to ensure calculate functionality acts as expected
 * test cases may be expanded upon

 ### Current Test Cases:
| Operation               | Test Details               |
| -------------           |:-------------:             |
| addition                | assert 5 + 3 = 8           |
| subtraction             | assert 2 - 8 = -6          |
| multiplication          | assert 44.5 * 10 = 445     |
| modulo                  | assert 3 % 5 = 3           |
| exponent                | assert 5 ^ 3 = 125         |
